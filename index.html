  <meta name="description" content="Comes to Life is an interactive digital heritage experience that reimagines Ancient Egyptian history through games, manga storytelling, and immersive technology.

Visitors do not simply observe history — they influence it.
Choices made within stories shape tombs, puzzles, and endings, reflecting the ancient belief that memory and morality define legacy.

This project explores how technology can preserve the past while inviting modern audiences to actively engage with it.
